# Bazzite for the Surface Book 2 13"

# Adds the IPTS touchscreen/pen driver (patched for Linux 7.x), iptsd, and a
# base-hub USB fix on top of the stock Bazzite KDE image.

# CI resolves BASE_IMAGE to a digest and reads KERNEL_VERSION from its
# ostree.linux label, so the module is always built for the exact kernel.
